# zig-game-editor

This is the editor I'm going to be using when developing my game.

## Installation

1. If you want to try it out you can change some settings in the `src/config.zig` file:

```zig
// Set these to your liking
pub const fontPath = "C:/Windows/Fonts/calibri.ttf";
pub const tileSize = Vector{ 16, 16 };
```

2. Clone the repo and run `zig build run`.
